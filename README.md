# kRPC2 - Remote Procedure Calls for Kerbal Space Program 2

[![ci](https://github.com/krpc/krpc2/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/krpc/krpc2/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

kRPC2 allows you to control Kerbal Space Program 2 from scripts running outside of
the game, and comes with client libraries for many popular languages.

This is a continuation of the kRPC mod for Kerbal Space Program 1, which can be found here: https://github.com/krpc/krpc

## Installing

Requires SpaceWarp/BepInEx to be installed.

Download the release archive and extract it into the BepInEx folder.

## Current Status

The mod is a very early work in progress, so don't expect much!

Currently there is a single "service", called SpaceCenter2, with a few properties for basic telemetry.

It works with the existing kRPC client libraries (as it speaks the same protocol).
However we don't yet provide generated stubs for clients like C++, C# and Java.
It has only been tested using the python client, which does not require
generated stubs (it can auto-generate them on connection).

When the game starts, a server is created with RPC port 50000 and Stream port 50001.
There is no configuration for this yet - it is hard coded in.

Here's an example in Python, with all the currently available telemetry:
```
import krpc
conn = krpc.connect()
print(conn.space_center2.active_vessel.orbit.eccentricity)
print(conn.space_center2.active_vessel.orbit.apoapsis)
print(conn.space_center2.active_vessel.orbit.periapsis)
```

## Development

This mod is in the early stages of development - there is lots to do and help is greatly appreciated!

## Building on Linux

 * [Install Bazel](https://bazel.build/install/)
 * Create a symlink from `lib/ksp2` to where you have Kerbal Space Program 2 installed, so that you have `lib/ksp2/KSP_x64_Data/Managed/...`
 * Run `bazel build //:krpc2`
 * The resulting plugin archive is placed in `bazel-bin/krpc2-VERSION.zip`

### Developing with Nix

To install dependencies and start a development environment with Nix, run `nix develop`.
This will install all the required programs, from there configure your system to build as on a regular Linux system.
Running `nix build .#krpc2` will build your active source against the stripped compilation libraries used in continuous integration.

## Building on Windows

Using Bazel:
 * [Install Bazel](https://bazel.build/install/)
   * Ensure you install MSYS2 to C:\tools\msys64 NOT the default path
   * If your user directory contains spaces, the build may not work. If this is the case, create a file called
     `%ProgramData%/bazel.bazelrc` containing the following:
     ```
     startup --output_user_root="C:/bazel-root"
     ```
   * If you get permissions errors related to symlinks when building you need to enable "Developer Mode".
 * Put a copy of KSP2 in lib/ksp2 (so you have `lib/ksp2/KSP_x64_Data/Managed/...`)
 * Run `bazel build //:krpc2`
 * The resulting plugin archive is placed in `bazel-bin/krpc2-VERSION.zip`

Using Visual Studio:
 * First you need to setup Bazel (see above for instructions). This is needed to generate a few files that are required to build the solution.
 * Run `bazel build //:csproj`. This puts all the required files in `bazel-bin/csproj/...`
 * Open `KRPC2.sln`.
 * Fetch the remaining dependencies using nuget and build the project.
